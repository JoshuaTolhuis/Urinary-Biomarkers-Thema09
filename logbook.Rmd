##### Date : di 14 sep,  
- Created repository.  
- Chose a data set.
- Added log.  
- Checked  data set's documentation
- Added data file to repository (data gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/urinary-biomarkers-for-pancreatic-cancer))
- Created an empty EDA file
- Added EDA file to repository
- Created a logbook to keep track of progression

##### Date : wo 15 sep,
- Working from home (sick)
- Made some adjustments to the log
- Read the corresponding research paper
- Formulated a few questions to gain insight on a possible research question, or to look at in the EDA:
  * How is  REG1B	beter than	REG1A?
  * Can you predict Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) beter with REG1B than REG1A? 
  * How well can an algorythm predict PDAC with the improved biomarker?
  * Is it possible to use machine learning to predict PDAC (and its stages) with the biomarker? (same as John Davis)  
  * Does REG1B affect machine learning predictions for a beter outcome than REG1A?  
  * Can you predict the stages of PDAC with only using REG1B?

##### Date: di 21 sep,
- Figured out final research question:  
  "What's the minimal amount of data combinations to predict a patient has pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?"  
- Started work on the EDA and log, tried to combine several data values kind of like simple "oneR's".  
- Made a few plot's that I'm trying to use to get a better understanding of the biomarkers.
- Need to find out what makes these biomarkers relation to each other and the stages of PDAC.
- Need to create a boxplot with all 3 biomarkes and use this to determine the avere combined heights to find out a relation to this and the stage
