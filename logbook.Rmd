- Chose a data set.
- Added log.  
- Checked  data set's documentation
- Added data file to repository (data gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/urinary-biomarkers-for-pancreatic-cancer))
- Created an empty EDA file
- Added EDA file to repository
- Created a logbook to keep track of progression

##### Date : wo 15 sep,
- Working from home (sick)
- Made some adjustments to the log
- read the corresponding research paper
- formulated a few questions to gain insight on a possible research question, or to look at in the EDA:
  * How is  REG1B	beter than	REG1A?
  * Can you predict Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) beter with REG1B than REG1A? 
  * How well can an algorythm predict PDAC with the improved biomarkers?
  * Is it possible to use machine learning to predict PDAC with the biomarkers? (same as John Davis)
  * Does REG1B affect machine learning predictions for a beter outcome than REG1A?
